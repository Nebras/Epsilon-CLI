h1. Epsilon Command-Line Interface (CLI)

A simple command-line interface for Epsilon. "Download":https://github.com/louismrose/Epsilon-CLI/raw/master/epsilon_cli.jar and run:

@java -jar epsilon_cli.jar@

The following mandatory command-line arguments must be specified:

@--mma <pathToMetamodelA> --mmb <pathToMetamodelB> --transf <pathToEpsilonProgram> --ma <pathToModelA> --mb <pathToModelB> --log <pathToLogFile>@

h2. Supported Languages

The following Epsilon languages are supported:
* Epsilon Object Language (.eol)
* Epsilon Transformation Language (.etl)
* Epsilon Flock (.mig)

The file extension of the @<pathToEpsilonProgram>@ parameter determines which of the above Epsilon languages is used to manage the specified models.

h2. Supported Modelling Frameworks

Even though Epsilon supports many types of model, only EMF models are supported in this version of the CLI. 

h2. Other Important Information

When the @<pathToModelA>@ or @<pathToModelB>@ parameter specifies a file that does not exist, Epsilon CLI will treat that model as write-only, otherwise the model is treated as read-write. In other words, Epsilon CLI will always overwrite existing models.
